This repo holds powershell scripts that I figure out how to build, generally on request from other people. Often there are parts of these scripts in different places on the web and I spent time putting them into a single script that works.

## Save-ClipboardImage
This script will save an image from the clipboard. Currently hard codes the location of the file and only has a single name for the image. Both should be changed before being used in any real capacity.
